# Fubuki's Code of Conduct

1. **Be** polite and gentle. Don't aggress people in issues, pull requests, commit comments, or other participating places. Don't use vulgar language.
2. **Do not** discuss politics, or any personal beliefs.
3. **Do** discuss technical beliefs and opinions on design, algorithms, existing code and potential new code.
4. **Do not** (willingly) create duplicate issues. Such issues will be closed as duplicates of the oldest one reporting the same problem or requesting the same feature.
5. **Do not** comment "I have the same issue" on an issue (or any similar phrasing), ***unless*** it provides an additional case in which the problem occurs. In which case, please _do_ comment, and add your additional example code.
    - Instead, please add reactions to the top-level comment.
